    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Laden with luscious strawberry essence, these compact cupcakes boast a luxurious moistness reminiscent of pound cake rather than the usual airy cupcake texture. It's imperative to ensure that all ingredients are brought to room temperature, around 70°F, prior to blending. This recipe is easily scalable and the cupcakes can be frozen to perfection.</p>
    <h4>Cupcakes Ingredients</h4>  
        <ul>
            <li>1.5 sticks unsalted butter (6 ounces or 12 tablespoons), brought to room temperature</li>

            <li>3/4 cup whole milk, brought to room temperature</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3 large eggs, brought to room temperature</li>
            <li><strong>Strawberry Cream Cheese Frosting</strong> (recipe follows)</li>
            <li>Colorful sprinkles and decoratifs (optional)</li>
            <li>12-cup muffin pan (1⁄2 cup capacity per cup)</li>
            <li>12 cupcake liners</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Strawberry Cream Cheese Frosting</h4>  
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8-ounce) box cream cheese, brought to room temperature</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, brought to room temperature</li>  
            <li>2 tablespoons strawberry jam, melted in the microwave until just warm</li>  
            <li>1 (1-pound) box plus 1⁄4 cup confectioners’ sugar, or more as needed to thicken frosting</li>  
            <li>Red food coloring, as needed to color your favorite shade of pink</li> 
        </ul>    
    <h4>Baking Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F and position a rack in the middle.</li>
            <li>Place cupcake liners in the muffin pan.</li>
            <li>Use a stand mixer with the paddle attachment to combine butter and sugar. Mix on low for 30 seconds, then switch to high for approximately 8 minutes until light and fluffy (creaming), scraping the bowl sides occasionally.</li>
            <li>Sift cake flour, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl, whisk in gelatin, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Mix mashed strawberries, milk, and vanilla in a separate bowl.</li>
            <li>Gradually add eggs to the butter mixture, mixing well after each addition.</li>
            <li>Reduce mixer speed and alternate adding portions of the flour mixture and milk mixture, mixing until combined.</li>
            <li>Continue adding and mixing until a smooth batter forms.</li>
            <li>Use an ice cream scoop to evenly portion the batter into muffin cups.</li>
            <li>Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until cupcakes pass the toothpick test, then cool them.</li>
            <li>Frost the cooled cupcakes and adorn them with decorations as desired.</li>
            <li><strong>Optional:</strong> Store baked and cooled cupcakes in an airtight container for up to 2 days.</li>
            <li><strong>Helpful hint:</strong> Lightly coat the ice cream scoop with vegetable oil spray for easy scooping and cleaning.</li>
        </ol>
    <h4>Frosting Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the cream cheese, butter, and melted jam in the bowl of a stand mixer. Fit it with the paddle attachment. Mix on low speed until the ingredients are all combined. On low speed, add the confectioners’ sugar and mix until completely combined.</li>
            <li>Increase the speed to high, and mix until the frosting is light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Throughout the mixing process, stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed.</li>
            <li>Put the frosting in the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes before you try to use it for piping or spreading on the cupcakes. This will help to stiffen up the frosting.</li>
            <li><strong>Make It Ahead:</strong> Make the frosting up to 3 days in advance. Store, tightly wrapped, in the refrigerator. The baked and completely cooled unfrosted cupcakes will stay fresh in an airtight container for up to 2 days.</li>
        </ol>
